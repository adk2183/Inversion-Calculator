InversionCounter is a Java program designed to count the number of inversions in an array of integers. 
An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. 
This program provides two methods for counting inversions:

A slow method that runs in O(n^2) time complexity.
A fast method that utilizes mergesort to achieve O(n log n) time complexity.
